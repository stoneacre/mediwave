shortDescription: Achieved CARF accreditation in record time while building a secure patient portal that improved treatment outcomes and streamlined compliance reporting
---

##### Project overview

Bridges Behavioral Health needed to achieve CARF accreditation to expand their adolescent treatment programs and improve insurance reimbursements. Their existing systems couldn't support the rigorous documentation and outcome tracking required for accreditation, putting their expansion plans at risk.

Beyond compliance, Dr. Martinez wanted to enhance family involvement in treatment while maintaining appropriate boundaries and confidentiality for their young patients. The solution needed to satisfy accreditation requirements while actually improving the therapeutic process.

##### What we did for this project

We created an integrated compliance and patient engagement system that exceeded accreditation standards while making documentation feel less burdensome for clinicians and more meaningful for treatment planning.

##### Project results

Bridges Behavioral Health achieved CARF accreditation on their first attempt, just 5 months after implementation - typically a 12-18 month process. Insurance reimbursement rates increased by 25%, enabling them to offer more sliding-scale spots for underserved families.

The family portal improved treatment engagement, with 85% of families actively participating in the therapeutic process. Clinical outcomes improved by 40% as measured by standardized assessments. Staff reported spending 50% less time on documentation while producing higher quality clinical notes. The practice successfully launched two new adolescent programs and became a preferred provider for three major insurance networks.
