shortDescription: Transformed a solo therapy practice into a thriving 8-therapist clinic with 45% patient growth through ethical digital marketing and HIPAA-compliant systems
---

##### Project overview

Harmony Wellness Center came to us as a solo therapy practice struggling to manage growth while maintaining quality care. Dr. Chen needed a comprehensive digital presence that would attract the right patients while ensuring complete HIPAA compliance and respecting the therapeutic relationship.

The challenge was creating a warm, approachable online presence that reduced stigma around seeking mental health support while implementing systems that could scale with the practice's rapid growth. Every element needed to reflect the practice's trauma-informed approach and commitment to inclusive care.

##### What we did for this project

We developed a complete digital ecosystem that balanced clinical professionalism with accessibility, ensuring every touchpoint respected patient privacy while encouraging those seeking help to reach out.
