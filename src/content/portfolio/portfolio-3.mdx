##### Project overview

Serenity Counseling Collective specializes in anxiety and depression treatment but struggled with community awareness in a conservative area where mental health stigma runs deep. Dr. Thompson wanted to normalize therapy and reach underserved populations without using traditional advertising that could feel invasive or triggering.

The challenge was creating an educational campaign that would resonate with hesitant individuals while respecting the sensitivity of mental health topics. Every message needed to reduce barriers to seeking help while maintaining the practice's professional credibility.

##### What we did for this project

We developed a community-focused awareness campaign that educated while empowering, using storytelling and evidence-based content to gently challenge misconceptions about mental health treatment.

##### Project results

The campaign transformed how the community viewed mental health support. Website traffic increased by 200% with visitors spending 4x longer reading educational content. The free workshop series attracted over 500 attendees, with 30% scheduling initial consultations.

New patient inquiries shifted from crisis-only to preventive care, with 60% citing the educational content as their reason for reaching out. The practice grew from 2 to 6 therapists to meet demand. Most significantly, follow-up surveys showed 78% of workshop attendees felt less stigma about seeking therapy, creating lasting change in community attitudes toward mental health.
