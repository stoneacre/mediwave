##### What information do we collect?

We collect the essentials: your name, email, phone number, and practice details - basically what you'd share at a networking event, minus the awkward small talk. We also track how you use our site (like which pages you visit), but don't worry - we're analyzing website behavior, not yours.

##### How we use your information

1. To help grow your practice with targeted marketing strategies and operational improvements.<br/>
2. To send you helpful resources, tips, and updates (all relevant, no spam - we respect boundaries).<br/>
3. To provide customer support and answer your questions about growing your practice.

##### Your privacy rights

1. You can request to see what information we have about you - full transparency, no hidden notes.<br/>
2. You have the right to update or delete your information at any time - your data, your choice.<br/>
3. You can opt out of marketing communications while still receiving important service updates.

##### Data security

Your information is protected with bank-level encryption and security measures. We take confidentiality as seriously as you do, implementing HIPAA-compliant practices even when not legally required. Only authorized team members can access your data, and only when necessary to serve you.

##### HIPAA compliance

While Mediwave is not a covered entity under HIPAA, we understand the importance of protecting health information. We sign Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) when required and maintain HIPAA-compliant security standards throughout our operations. We never access, store, or process patient health information unless explicitly required for agreed-upon services.

##### Third-party sharing

We only share your information with trusted service providers who help us deliver our services (all bound by strict confidentiality agreements) and when required by law. We NEVER sell your data - that would be a serious boundary violation.

##### Cookies and tracking

We use cookies to remember your preferences and understand how you use our site. These include:

- Essential cookies for site functionality
- Analytics cookies to improve our services
- Marketing cookies to provide relevant content

You can control cookie preferences through your browser settings.

##### Data retention

We keep your information only as long as necessary to provide our services and comply with legal obligations. Typically:

- Active client data: Duration of service + 7 years
- Marketing contacts: Until you unsubscribe
- Website analytics: 26 months

You can request deletion at any time.

##### Children's privacy

Our services are for mental health professionals only. We do not knowingly collect information from anyone under 18. If we discover we've accidentally collected such data, we'll delete it immediately.

##### Policy updates

We may update this policy occasionally to reflect changes in our services or legal requirements. When we do, we'll notify you via email - think of it as keeping you informed about updates to our approach. Continued use of our services after changes means you accept the updated policy.
