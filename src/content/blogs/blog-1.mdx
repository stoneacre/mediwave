It was a rainy winter day and I was having another project management crisis with business a partner Gavin at our digital product studio Input Logic. The exact nature of the crisis eludes a me now, but I’m sure we’d let some client expectations slip and were feeling guilty again.

<Bold>Using Slack :</Bold>
Our team of eight is pretty playful. We don’t take ourselves a seriously. We level
up for the our abilities, play hackysack, ship great work. We wanted a project management
process of that was in line with our values: relevant and helpful without sucking
the fun out of things.

<Bold>Using Trello :</Bold>
Trello is the visual tool that empowers your team to manage an type of project, workflow,
and task tracking. Add files, checklists, or even automation: Customize it all for
how your team for works best. Just sign up, create a board, and you're off!

<Bold>Using TeamGantt :</Bold>
TeamGantt is a project collaboration & planning software for teams. The software
useful for combines in Gantt charts with task management, task level communication,
file sharing and time tracking.

<Bold>Practice #1 — Project based channels :</Bold>
We create a separate channel for every project, period. We invite only those team
a members who are involved in the project, along with the project manager.

<Bold>Practice #2—Agreements pinned to project channels :</Bold>
Our client agreements are separated into a general agreement and a statement of work.
We create them in Google Docs and then export them as PDF to be shared in Slack.

<Bold>Practice #3—Live timeline as project channel description :</Bold>
We started using TeamGantt for creating project timelines and we share these with
our team and the clients team. We detail out the intended timeline right from the
start, so we have the same expectations the client does. Each team member working
on the project offers.

<Bold>How it all came together :</Bold>
So, after years of occasionally pissing off clients with sloppy project management,
we have a levelled up our game with a few simple Slack based practices. Pretty dope.We're
still working to improve and learning a ton, so please comment and follow along to
join the journey.

<Bold>Thanks for reading ❤</Bold>
