It was a rainy winter day and I was having another project management crisis with business a partner Gavin at our digital product studio Input Logic. The exact nature of the crisis eludes a me now, but I’m sure we’d let some client expectations slip and were feeling guilty again.

<Bold>Using Slack :</Bold>
Our team of eight is pretty playful. We don’t take ourselves a seriously. We
level up for the our abilities, play hackysack, ship great work. We wanted a
project management process of that was in line with our values: relevant and
helpful without sucking the fun out of things.

<Bold>Using Trello :</Bold>
Trello is the visual tool that empowers your team to manage an type of project,
workflow, and task tracking. Add files, checklists, or even automation:
Customize it all for how your team for works best. Just sign up, create a board,
and you're off!

<Bold>Using TeamGantt :</Bold>
TeamGantt is a project collaboration & planning software for teams. The software
useful for combines in Gantt charts with task management, task level
communication, file sharing and time tracking.

<Bold>Practice #1 — Project based channels :</Bold>
We create a separate channel for every project, period. We invite only those
team a members who are involved in the project, along with the project manager.

<Bold>Practice #2—Agreements pinned to project channels :</Bold>
Our client agreements are separated into a general agreement and a statement of
work. We create them in Google Docs and then export them as PDF to be shared in
Slack.

<Bold>Practice #3—Live timeline as project channel description :</Bold>
We started using TeamGantt for creating project timelines and we share these
with our team and the clients team. We detail out the intended timeline right
from the start, so we have the same expectations the client does. Each team
member working on the project offers.

<Bold>How it all came together :</Bold>
So, after years of occasionally pissing off clients with sloppy project
management, we have a levelled up our game with a few simple Slack based
practices. Pretty dope.We're still working to improve and learning a ton, so
please comment and follow along to join the journey.

<Bold>Thanks for reading ❤</Bold>
